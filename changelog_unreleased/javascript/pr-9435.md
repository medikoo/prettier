#### Fix formatting for `import {a as a}` and `export {a as a}` (#9435 by @fisker)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
import { a as a } from "a";
export { b as b } from "b";

// Prettier stable
import { a } from "a";
export { b } from "b";

// Prettier master
import { a as a } from "a";
export { b as b } from "b";
```
