```yaml
# Input
flow-mapping:
  {
    "object-does-not-fit-within-print-width": "------",
    "TEST": "comma IS added here"
  }
flow-sequence:
  [
    "object-does-not-fit-within-print-width", "------",
    "TEST", "comma IS added here"
  ]

# Prettier stable
mapping:
  {
    "object-does-not-fit-within-print-width": "------",
    "TEST": "comma IS added here",
  }
flow-sequence:
  [
